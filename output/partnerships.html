		<p id="podinfo" style="width: 65%;height: auto;">If you're considering a partnership with us, you already know how complex the weather is in the Carolinas. For the time being, we do not intend to produce daily, region-wide forecasts, but if you already produce one for your community, we'll include a link to it on our website. You've likely built connections with hundreds, if not thousands of other weather geeks in your area. We've found that the majority of people are interested in the weather, but disatisfied with the way in which they receive their weather information. With your help, we want to change that. Let's work together to keep our communities weather-aware, and provide a fun, educational environment for everyday weather geeks to get involved.</p>
		<p id="podinfo" style="width: 65%;height: auto;">Currently, a whopping 71.7% (ABC News) of people get their forecast and subsequent weather information from non-local sources. While the Weather Channels of the world do an excellent job at regional forecasting, they consistently miss the mark when it comes to understanding local impacts. We work with local TV markets and NWS offices to combat misinformation and educate our communites on upcoming weather events. We're quite active on social media, and we know how active you all are. Tens of thousands of people get their weather information from local organizations like yours, but there's still a lot of work to be done to move the public away from regionally-generalized, model-heavy forecasts. Consider joining  us in this endeavour by partnering with Carolina Weather Group, LLC and continuing to provide quality, local weather information.</p>
